# How to Backup Your Microsoft Office Activation
Before reinstalling Windows or Office, it's smart to back up your license:
1. Navigate to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16` or your version folder.
2. Find the file called **Token.dat**.
3. Copy and save it in a safe place (like a USB drive).
4. After reinstall, replace the new `Token.dat` with your backup (same folder).
5. Restart your PC.
> **Note:** This only works if reinstalling on the same hardware.
